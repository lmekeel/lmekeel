# Background Story
I have been in the fashion modeling industry for over 10 years, modeling on countless print, commercial, and runway jobs. Although I have had many wonderful experiences and met some amazing people, I found that the work I was doing as a model was not fulfilling for me. In 2021, I consulted a career counselor who had me take several personality and career aptitude tests. Software engineering kept coming to the top of the list! I didn't have any coding experience, but I decided to return to school and change my major to Computer Science. During that time, I took a mobile app development class in Android and found my passion for mobile development. I graduated with my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, in September of 2023. After graduating, I decided to focus on iOS development and have not looked back. I know I still have a lot to learn, but can't wait for the opportunity to work on a team and build some super cool apps!
